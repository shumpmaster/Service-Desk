# Fixtures for the desk's tests (spec S-001, J1, J2, J9)

- `service-desk/`: real Service-Desk files, copied unchanged with `git show`:
  - `queue/`, `decisions/`, `questions/_TEMPLATE.md`, `decisions/questions/Q-005-sources.md` and
    `governance/ROUTING.toml` at 7da0fd7 (main on 2026-10-06);
  - `questions/Q-005-sources.md` at 4f2439a (the question before it was answered and deleted);
  - `dispatch-log/2026-10.jsonl` at e2ab9c5 (its 192 lines on 2026-10-06);
  - `status/P-001@<commit>.toml` at d4d0110 (dispatched), def1e83 (waiting-owner), b787280 (ready)
    and 7da0fd7 (closed).
- `github/`: real GitHub REST responses for Service-Desk (a public repository), recorded on
  2026-10-07 without the desk's token: status 200, the headers the function reads, and the body
  exactly as GitHub sent it. Each file's `note` names the request.
- `poom/`: Personal-Org-Operating-Model is private, so its files are NOT copied here. These
  fixtures hold only the lines S-001 J9 quotes from it at 677fe5a (the open sprint's title and
  status line, the last ledger entry's heading, `date:` and `licenses_next:` lines), in the files'
  real form, with placeholder text where the spec quotes nothing.
